The Urturn media player is built to support sources from SoundCloud, iTunes, YouTube, Vimeo and DailyMotion.

One of the biggest challenge is the player’s expansion animation. We gave priority to CSS transforms and use JS animations sparingly to ensure good performances on mobile devices.

While working remotely with developers, we use detailed animation views like the following. This is a way to put words on the elements which improve communication.

This kind of view is really helpful when the animation needs a little tweak:

> “At 0.6s, we can set the artwork enlargement to 0.2s instead of 0.3s”
