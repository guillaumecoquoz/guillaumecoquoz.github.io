Wonderalp is a cabinet of curiosities based on Alps travel diaries written by scientists from the 16th to the 18th century in Switzerland. The app showcases engraving illustrations and tales that guide the user between myth and science and help to understand the scientists’ wonder at nature at that time.

The application available on the {% include template_link-target-blank.html href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/wonderalp/id1042221833" txt="App&nbsp;Store" %} and the {% include template_link-target-blank.html href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wonderalp.fr" txt="Play&nbsp;Store" %}. It has been designed and developed as a web app because it’s meant to be a website in the future. The grid layout is fluid and adjustable to a responsive environment.

The navigation has been thought to give the user a feeling of travel and discovery. The sound design and the stories told by theatre actors are meant to intensify the immersion into this singular world.

Images are a fundamental component of the application and so they have been handled with a special care. The challenge was to find the best compression libraries such as {% include template_link-target-blank.html href="https://github.com/pornel/pngquant" txt="pngquant" %} or {% include template_link-target-blank.html href="https://github.com/tjko/jpegoptim" txt="jpegotpim" %} to limit files size while keeping a good image quality and ensure a respectful rendering of the archived documents.

The stories gathered by those atypical scientists are transmitted through writings so good typography treatment is important. The {% include template_link-target-blank.html href="http://optimo.ch/typefaces_Stanley_all_FontInformation.html" txt="Stanley" %} typeface has a contemporary design inspired by ancient documentation as much as the application itself and so it’s a perfect match in this context.

For this project I was in charge of both Visual and Interaction Design. I collaborated closely with the client on Information Architecture through regular meetings and workshops. We had to respect both the scientific value of the content and the User Centered Design approach.
